👋 Welcome to my dotfiles git repository! This repository is designed to work seamlessly with GNU Stow, allowing you to easily manage your dotfiles across multiple machines.

📁 The repository is organized into various directories, each corresponding to a particular configuration file or set of files. You can simply clone the repository and then use Stow to symlink the appropriate directories to your home directory.

👍 This approach makes it easy to keep your dotfiles under version control and synchronize them across different machines. Plus, it lets you quickly set up a new machine with your preferred configuration.
